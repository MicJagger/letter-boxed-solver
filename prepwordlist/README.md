# prepwordlist

Rust program for trimming down a word list into ones that are possible in letter boxed

This includes removing words 1 or 2 letters long, as well as removing words with any letters repeated in a row

Credit for the word list goes to John Lawler and his sources, downloaded from @ https://websites.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html
