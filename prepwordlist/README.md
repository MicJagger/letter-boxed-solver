# prepwordlist

Rust program for trimming down a word list into ones that are possible in letter boxed

This includes removing words 1 or 2 letters long, as well as removing words with any letters repeated in a row

Credit for the 10,000 word list goes to MIT @ https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000
